    content: "Planets are fun. Seriously, they’re some of the coolest things in the Universe — and in video games. Big shoutout to games like Outer Wilds, No Man's Sky, and tools like SpaceEngine and Universe Sandbox, which let you appreciate the intricacies of planetary design. So, I attempted, at first as a rookie, to generate a ball with a height-map. Next, I tried to generate a planet where you can adjust the radius, color, surface texture and noise. This noise handling is what makes the planet spikey. These are scientifically not possible but wouldn't our universe be super cool with them? Anyways, currently I'm trying to put my planets in an orbit and hope they don’t just float aimlessly around the void. NASA's previous years Space Apps Challenge has great resources on the Kepler's Laws and generation of orbits. Feel free to check those out if you wanna cook your very own playthings. Also a big thank you to SebLague Tutorials. Great teacher, inspiring coder, hats off."

I love to see the knots untangling in their brain and the Light bulb moment that slowly lits up on their faces. So, I am making videos explaining topics. Although I love/need constant feedbacks; kinda like a trial & error thingy (my explaination runs on feedbacks). But you can still give these Vidsplainers a try.'
